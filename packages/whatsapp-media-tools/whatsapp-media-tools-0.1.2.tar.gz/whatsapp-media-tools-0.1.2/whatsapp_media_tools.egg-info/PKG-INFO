# whatsapp-media-tools
Python scripts to manage WhatsApp media backups for archival purposes.

## Usage

### Installation
` pip install whatsapp_media_tools`


### Restoring exif dates
```
usage: restore-exif [-h] [-r] [-m] [-v] path

Restore discarded Exif date information in WhatsApp media based on the filename. For videos, only the created and modified dates are set.

positional arguments:
  path             Path to WhatsApp media folder

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -r, --recursive  Recursively process media
  -m, --mod        Set file created/modified date on top of exif for images
  -v, --version    show program's version number and exit
```

### Finding duplicate media files
```
usage: find-duplicates [-h] [-c CHUNK_SIZE] [-f] [-r] [--dry-run] [-v] path

Remove duplicated media, preserving the file with the shortest filename or earliest date encoded in the filename.

positional arguments:
  path                  Path to WhatsApp media folder

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CHUNK_SIZE, --chunk-size CHUNK_SIZE
                        Chunk size for heuristic, smaller values are generally faster but if many files have identical starting chunks, performance degrades as more full hashes are computed
  -f, --force           Delete duplicates without prompting
  -r, --recursive       Recursively process media
  --dry-run             Dry run deletion (no files deleted)
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  ```
