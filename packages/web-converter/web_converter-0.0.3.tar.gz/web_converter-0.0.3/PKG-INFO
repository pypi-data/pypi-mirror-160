>>> string = 'Referer: https://github.com/'

>>> print(example)
{'Referer': 'https://github.com/'}
>>> print(type(example))
<class 'dict'>
```

### Usage for cookies:
```
>>> from web_converter.converter import convert_cookies
>>> cookies = 'session_id=aBrwmYi5G8CSST011Dkb'
>>> example_cookies = convert_cookies(string)
