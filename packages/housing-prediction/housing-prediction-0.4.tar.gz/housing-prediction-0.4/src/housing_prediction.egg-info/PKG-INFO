# Median housing value prediction

The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest

## Steps performed
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

## Setup for development
### Create conda environment
```console
foo@bar:~$ conda env create -f deploy/conda/linux_cpu_py39.yml 
foo@bar:~$ conda activate mle-dev 
```

### Perform test
Tox have been configured with pytest to automate testing in virtualenv. 
```console
foo@bar:~$ tox 
```
Test a specific test file:
```console
foo@bar:~$ tox -- -k <file_name>
```

## Usage
### Install package
#### Option 1. From github:
```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/rishitoshsingh-ta/mle-training.git
foo@bar:~$ cd mle-training
foo@bar:~$ pip install .
```
#### Option 2. From PyPi

```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install housing-prediction
```

#### Test installation:
To test whether the package is successfully installed or not, start python session, and try to import housing. If it's imported successfully, then installation is complete

```console
foo@bar:~$ python
>>> import housing
```


It will install all the dependencies and the housing package

### Run mlflow server
    As mlflow tracking is used in this project, first mlflow server needs to be started. In he command below, \<directory> can be file:///home/user/artifacts , where you want to store mlruns data

```console
foo@bar:~$ mlflow server \
      --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db \
      --default-artifact-root <dricetory> \
      --host 0.0.0.0 \
      --port 8889 
```

### Run scripts

There are two ways to run the scripts, as single command line tool and as python scripts.

* As command line tool
    ```console
    foo@bar:~$ housing
    ```

* As python scripts 

```console
foo@bar:~$ python -m housing.ingest_data
foo@bar:~$ python -m housing.train
foo@bar:~$ python -m housing.score
```

You can also access pass arguments, to find all available arguments:
```console
foo@bar:~$ housing --help
foo@bar:~$ python -m housing.ingest_data --help
foo@bar:~$ python -m housing.train
foo@bar:~$ python -m housing.score
```


### Default arguments
The defaults argument values are located in a **`.cfg`** file located in:
**`/path/to/env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/housing-prediction/housing.cfg`**. The defaults can be changes as per user preferences.
