Initial setup of LogBot:

  * Each of these entries must use a format matching the extant entries.<br><br>
* If you want LogBot to report into a different google chat change the url starting on line 13 of the logbot.py script.
  * Directions for how to do this can be found here: [https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks](https://developers.google.com/chat/how-tos/webhooks)
