## Installation

Install the latest build:
```
pip install bstats
```

## Examples

#### Sync example
```py
import bstats
client = bstats.SyncClient("token") # Never post any of your tokens for APIs on a public github!
player = client.get_player("80V2R98CQ")
print(player.trophies)
print(player.solo_victories)
club = player.club
if club:
    print(club.tag)
    members = club.members
    for player in members[:5]: # Get the top 5 club members
       print(player.name, player.trophies) # Show their name and their trophies
   # Get the top 5 players in the world
best_players = client.get_leaderboards(mode="players", limit=5)
for player in best_players:
    print(player.name, player.rank) # Show their name and their rank on the leaderboard
   # Get the top 5 Meg players in the United Kingdom
top_meg_players = client.get_leaderboards(
    mode="brawlers",
    country="GB",
    limit=5,
    brawler="Meg"
)
for player in top_meg_players:
    print(player.name, player.rank)
# Get a player's 25 most recent battles
battles = client.get_battlelogs("80V2R98CQ")
print(battles[0].mode_name) # Show the last mode the player battled in
rotation = client.get_event_rotation()
for event in rotation:
    print(event.start, event.end)
```

#### Async example
```py
import asyncio
import bstats
client = bstats.AsyncClient("token") # Never post any of your tokens for APIs on a public github!
# to use the async client, we'll need an async function
async def main():
    player = await client.get_player("80V2R98CQ")
    print(player.trophies)
    print(player.solo_victories)
    club = player.club
    if club:
       print(club.tag)
       members = club.members
       for player in members[:5]: # Get the top 5 club members
          print(player.name, player.trophies) # Show their name and their trophies
    # Get the top 5 players in the world
    best_players = await client.get_leaderboards(mode="players", limit=5)
    for player in best_players:
       print(player.name, player.rank) # Show their name and their rank on the leaderboard
    # Get the top 5 Meg players in the United Kingdom
    top_meg_players = await client.get_leaderboards(
       mode="brawlers",
       country="GB",
       limit=5,
       brawler="Meg"
    )
    for player in top_meg_players:
       print(player.name, player.rank)
    # Get a player's 25 most recent battles
    battles = await client.get_battlelogs("80V2R98CQ")
    print(battles[0].mode_name) # Show the last mode the player battled in
    rotation = await client.get_event_rotation()
    for event in rotation:
       print(event.start, event.end)
# we now create a loop to send us the data from the async client
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.run_until_complete(main())
```
