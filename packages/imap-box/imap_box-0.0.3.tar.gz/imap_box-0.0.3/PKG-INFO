        ## Questions
        1. After running the command `imap -m data/your_map_file`, nothing display and no errors!!!
        
        A: Check the permissions of the map file, if the current user does not have permissions, modify the permissions with the following commands.
        ```
        sudo chmod 777 data/your_map_file
        ```
