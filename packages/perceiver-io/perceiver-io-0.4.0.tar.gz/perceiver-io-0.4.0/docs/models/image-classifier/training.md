# Image classification

This is a blueprint for training the Perceiver IO config A image classifier (model details [here](construction.md))
on a [p4d.24xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) instance. It uses [ImageNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k)
as training dataset.

Coming soon ...
