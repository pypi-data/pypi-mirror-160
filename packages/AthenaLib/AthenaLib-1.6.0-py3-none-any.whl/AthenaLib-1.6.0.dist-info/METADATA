## Package Details
#### Details and features 
- A library of Python modules for Directive Athena related Packages
- Used as a dependency on most, if not all, "*Athena...*" packages
  - An exception to this rule is [AthenaColor](https://github.com/DirectiveAthena/AthenaColor) as this package is "dependency-less"

#### Python Version
- Supported Python versions: **3.10**
  - Other older versions of Python are not currently supported. 
  - These older versions will probably not be supported by [@AndreasSas](https://github.com/AndreasSas) himself, but if you want to contribute to the project and make this package compatible with older versions of Python, Pull requests are always welcome.
