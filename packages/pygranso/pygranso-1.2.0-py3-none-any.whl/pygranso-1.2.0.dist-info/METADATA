PyGRANSO: A PyTorch-enabled port of GRANSO with auto-differentiation

Please check https://ncvx.org for detailed instructions (introduction, installation, settings, examples...).

PyGRANSO is AGPL v3.0 licensed, but it also contains a small portion of GPL code.  Please see the LICENSE_INFO folder for more information.

## Brief Introduction

Optimizing nonconvex (NCVX) problems, especially nonsmooth and constrained ones, is an essential part of machine learning. However, it can be hard to reliably solve such problems without optimization expertise. Existing general-purpose NCVX optimization packages are powerful but typically cannot handle nonsmoothness. GRANSO is among the first optimization solvers targeting general nonsmooth NCVX problems with nonsmooth constraints, but, as it is implemented in MATLAB and requires the user to provide analytical gradients, GRANSO is often not a convenient choice in machine learning (especially deep learning) applications. To greatly lower the technical barrier, we introduce a new software package called NCVX, whose initial release contains the solver PyGRANSO, a PyTorch-enabled port of GRANSO incorporating auto-differentiation, GPU acceleration, tensor input, and support for new QP solvers. NCVX is built on freely available and widely used open-source frameworks, and as a highlight, can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind.

## Installation

Installing PyGRANSO is simple. Here is a step-by-step instruction:

1. Install [Python >= 3.9](https://www.python.org/)

2. Get the most recent PyGRANSO package (including examples and requirements file):

        git clone https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO.git
        cd PyGRANSO

3.  Install PyGRANSO solver from PyPI:

        pip install git+https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO.git

4. Install Dependencies from PyPI: 

    OS: **Linux** OR **Windows**; Compute Platform: **CUDA**:

        pip install -r requirements.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu111/torch_stable.html

    OS: **Linux**; Compute Platform: **CPU**:

        pip install -r requirements_linux_cpu.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu/torch_stable.html

    OS: **Mac** OR **Windows**; Compute Platform: **CPU**:

        pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt
    
5. (CUDA) Run test to make sure the dependency installation is correct:

        python test_cuda.py

    (CPU) Run test to make sure the dependency installation is correct:

        python test_cpu.py

6. Check the [example folder](./examples) in the source code or [example section](https://ncvx.org/examples) on the documentation website to get started.

## Notes on Documentation

PyGRANSO is a PyTorch-enabled port of GRANSO with auto-differentiation, and some of its documentation uses MATLAB conventions. In the PyGRANSO source code docstrings, please note that:

* `struct` refers to `pygransoStruct`, which is a simple class that users need to use for specifying their problems and options.
* Vector and matrix refer to PyTorch tensor with *(n,1)* and *(m,n)* dimension, respectively.
