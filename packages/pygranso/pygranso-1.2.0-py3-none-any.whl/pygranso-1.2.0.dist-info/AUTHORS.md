* Buyun Liang (https://buyunliang.org/)
    * Ported GRANSO to Python, thus creating PyGRANSO (https://github.com/sun-umn/PyGRANSO)
    * Added built-in support for PyTorch, including:
        * auto-differentiation for computing gradients
        * GPU acceleration
        * tensor input
    * Support for new QP solvers
    * Added many new examples
    * Maintains associated website (https://ncvx.org/)

* Ju Sun (http://www.sunju.org/)
    * Advised the development of PyGRANSO.
