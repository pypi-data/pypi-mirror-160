> ### ðŸŒ± Just sprouting!
> This project is in the very beginning stages of development. It's not well tested and is only intended to be used as a demo.

## Installation

``` shell
pip install streamlit-tfx
```

## Getting started

```python
import streamlit_tfx as st_tfx

st_tfx.display(item)
st_tfx.display_statistics(statistics)
st_tfx.display_schema(schema)
st_tfx.display_anomalies(anomalies)
st_tfx.display_eval_result_plot(eval_result)
st_tfx.display_eval_result_slicing_attributions(eval_result)
st_tfx.display_eval_result_slicing_metrics(eval_result)
st_tfx.display_eval_results_time_series(eval_results)
```

Most artifacts in `tests/artifacts/` were generated by running the [TFX Keras Component tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/tfx/components_keras).
The anomalies artifact with anomalies was generated by running the [TensorFlow Model Analysis tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/model_analysis/tfma_basic).
