# :fire: FHIR Kindling

CRUD library for fhir servers, with resource validation and parsing powered by
the [pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic)
models created by [fhir.resources](https://github.com/nazrulworld/fhir.resources). More details in
the [Documentation](https://migraf.github.io/fhir-kindling/).

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, Delete resources using a FHIR server's REST API
- Transfer resources between servers while maintaining referential integrity using server-given IDs
- Bundle creation, validation and data management on a FHIR server via the REST API
- Supports Hapi, Blaze and IBM FHIR servers
- CSV serialization of query results
- Synthetic data generation and

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```shell
pip install fhir-kindling --user
```

## Usage

### Connecting to a FHIR server

```python
from fhir_kindling import FhirServer

# Connect with basic auth 
basic_auth_server = FhirServer("https://fhir.server/fhir", username="admin", password="admin")
# Connect with static token
token_server = FhirServer("https://fhir.server/fhir", token="your_token")

# Connect using oauth2/oidc
oidc_server = FhirServer("https://fhir.server/fhir", client_id="client_id", client_secret="secret",
                         oidc_provider_url="url")

# Print the server's capability statement
print(basic_auth_server.capabilities)

```

### Query resources from the server

#### Basic resource query

```python
from fhir_kindling import FhirServer
from fhir.resources.patient import Patient

# Connect using oauth2/oidc
oidc_server = FhirServer("https://fhir.server/fhir", client_id="client_id", client_secret="secret",
                         oidc_provider_url="url")

# query all patients on the server
query = oidc_server.query(Patient, output_format="json").all()
print(query.response)

# Query resources based on name of resource
query = oidc_server.query("Patient", output_format="json").all()
print(query.response)
```

#### Query with filters

Filtering the targeted resource is done using the `where` method on the query object. The filter is created by defining
the target field, the comparison operator and the value to compare.

```python
from fhir_kindling import FhirServer

server = FhirServer(api_address="https://fhir.server/fhir")

query = server.query("Patient").where(field="birthDate", operator="gt", value="1980").all()
```

#### Including related resources in the query

Resources that reference or are referenced by resources targeted by the query can be included in the response using
the `include` method on the query object.

```python
# server initialization omitted
# get the patients along with the queried conditions
query_patient_condition = server.query("Condition").include(resource="Condition", reference_param="subject").all()

# get the conditions for a patient
query_patient_condition = server.query("Patient")
query_patient_condition = query_patient_condition.include(resource="Condition", reference_param="subject", reverse=True)
response = query_patient_condition.all()
```

#### Query resources by reference
If you know the id and resource type of the resource you want to query, you can use the `get` method for a single reference 
for a list of references use `get_many`. The passed references should follow the format of `<resource_type>/<id>`.
```python
# server initialization omitted
patient = server.get("Patient/123")

patients = server.get_many(["Patient/123", "Patient/456"])

```


### Add resources to the server

Resources can be added to the server using the `add` method on the server object. Lists of resources can be added using
'add_all'.

```python
from fhir_kindling import FhirServer
from fhir.resources.patient import Patient

# Connect to the server
server = FhirServer(api_address="https://fhir.server/fhir")

# add a single resource
patient = Patient(name=[{"family": "Smith", "given": ["John"]}])
response = server.add(patient)

# add multiple resources
patients = [Patient(name=[{"family": f"Smith_{i}", "given": ["John"]}]) for i in range(10)]
response = server.add_all(patients)
```

### Deleting/Updating resources

Resources can be deleted from the server using the `delete` method on the server object, it takes as input either
references to the resources or the resources itself.  
Similarly the `update` method can be used to update the resources on the server, by passing a list of updated resources.

```python
from fhir_kindling import FhirServer
from fhir.resources.patient import Patient

# Connect to the server
server = FhirServer(api_address="https://fhir.server/fhir")

# add some patients
patients = [Patient(name=[{"family": f"Smith_{i}", "given": ["John"]}]) for i in range(10)]
response = server.add_all(patients)

# change the name of the patients
for patient in response.resources:
    patient.name[0].given[0] = "Jane"

# update the patients on the server
updated_patients = server.update(resources=response.resources)

# delete based on reference
server.delete(references=response.references[:5])
# delete based on resources
server.delete(resources=response.resources[5:])
```

### Transfer resources between servers
Transferring resources between servers is done using the `transfer` method on the server object. Using this method
server assigned ids are used for transfer and referential integrity is maintained.  
This method will also attempt to get all the resources that are referenced by the resources being transferred from the origin 
server and transfer them to the destination server as well.

```python
from fhir_kindling import FhirServer

# initialize the two servers
server_1 = FhirServer(api_address="https://fhir.server/fhir")
server_2 = FhirServer(api_address="https://fhir.server/fhir")

# query some resources from server 1
conditions = server_1.query("Condition").limit(10)
# transfer the resources to server 2
response = server_1.transfer(server_2, conditions)

```

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.9.0] - 2022-07-21
Asynchronous API for CRUD operations against fhir servers.

### Changed
- Switched http client library from requests [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/)
- removed requests-oauthlib in favor of authlib for oauth2 authentication flow
- `FHIRQuery` class renamed to `FHIRQuerySync` to allow for sync and async version
- moved resolving response pagination from `QueryReponse` to the sync and async query classes
- getting multiple resources via `server.get_many()` now uses proper batch requests

### Added
- `FHIRQueryAsync` class for async queries against a server
- asynchronous counterparts for CRUD operations in the `FHIRServer` class using the same API:
  - `query_async()`
  - `raw_query_async()`

  - `get_many_async()`
  - `add_async()`
