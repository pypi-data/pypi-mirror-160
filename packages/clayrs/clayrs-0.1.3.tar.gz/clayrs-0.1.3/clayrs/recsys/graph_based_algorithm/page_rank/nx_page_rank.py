    made by items in the user profile weighted by the score given to them.

    Args:
        alpha: Damping parameter for PageRank, default=0.85.
        personalized: Boolean value that specifies if the page rank must be calculated considering the user profile
            as personalization vector. Default is False
        max_iter: Maximum number of iterations in power method eigenvalue solver.
        tol: Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method solver.
        nstart: Starting value of PageRank iteration for each node.
        weight: Boolean value which tells the algorithm if weight of the edges must be considered or not.
