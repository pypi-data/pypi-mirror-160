# homework-py

## NOTICE

Only one singular school's renweb has been confirmed as being supported in initial requests. (This repo is very experiementaldjnkdjnsd) 

Hallo!! Homework-py is makeshift wrapper of the SIS-s[^1] I deal with as a student, and the library adds pythonic ways of tracking the general data a student may need to keep track of. 

### What can this be used for?

> In my personal opinion, there may be streamlined wrappers for systems like Canvas. The difference between this library and that library is that this library attempts > to simplify it down to a single cause - tracking a students todo-s and to-dones. (grades)

- Bots
- Personal Dashboards
- Alert Systems 


### Why is this existing when this has been solved before?

It is an educational project that I had passion for, so I chose to begin it despite knowing it could bear little fruit :).

**Aside from being a simple and *pointless-ish* educational project,** the main reasons I started this are found [here](reasons.md).

### Awesome dependencies of this library(!!)

(epicly doesn't have time to list them yet) (epicly puts on shades to express coolness factor)

### TODO

- [x] Basic Support for Moodle Calendar OOP Processing

> From my knowledge of (nothingness...) OOP, the library should be using a very basic form of OOP as of the first release. I am not sure though. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

- [x] Implement seperate data flagging for Renweb's calendar (PT 1)
- [ ] Implement seperate data flagging for Renweb's calendar (PT 2)
- [x] Implement Renweb Report Card Data Extraction 
- [ ] Clean up code with formatting and formatting
- [ ] Setup as a python package
- [ ] Release! (as a standard version with correct semantic versioning)
