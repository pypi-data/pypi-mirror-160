description = "GeoEnv is for those that don't want to create a geospatial development environment before you can test out some code you wrote, convert some spatial data or hack on an idea. The cli reduces the steps needed to spin up this working environment by using a docker image that already has a bunch of geospatial tools and libraries preloaded."
