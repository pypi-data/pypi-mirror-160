# Wordle Solver Lite
## A python package designed to solve the Wordle word-guessing game and many of its variants.

## Setup
You may download and install this package using pip
```bash
pip install wordle-autosolver-lite
```

## Usage
For more details on how to use this program, please refer to the original `wordle-autosolver` [ [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/wordle-autosolver/) | [Git](https://github.com/pueblak/wordle-autosolver) ]. This package is a simplified version of `wordle-autosolver` that behaves exactly the same but does not allow use of the "auto", "quiet", or "light" flags.
