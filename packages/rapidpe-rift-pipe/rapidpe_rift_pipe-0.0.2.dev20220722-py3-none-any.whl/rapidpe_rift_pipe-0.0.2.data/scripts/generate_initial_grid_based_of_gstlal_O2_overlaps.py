# The overlap files for the gstlal O2 template bank described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05121
# were generated by Heather Fong. 
# The overlap banks are split by Mchirp, with about 500 templates per subbank.
#
# This script sets up the command line to run lalsuite rapidpe_compute_intrinsic_grid to generate
# the initial grid for this rapidpe run. 
#
# For now the lalsuite code is only setup for grids in mass1 mass2 space. it needs to be expanded
#
# This script can be run in two ways
# generate_initial_grid_based_of_gstlal_O2_overlaps.py path_to_config_file
# or
# generate_initial_grid_based_of_gstlal_O2_overlaps.py path_to_config_file "{output_event_ID=name,intrinsic_param=[mass1=1.4,mass2=1.4]}"
# or with spin:
# generate_initial_grid_based_of_gstlal_O2_overlaps.py path_to_config_file "{output_event_ID=name,intrinsic_param=[mass1=1.4,mass2=1.4,spin1z=0.01,spin2z=0.01]}"
# 
# The output file is placed in the event directory
