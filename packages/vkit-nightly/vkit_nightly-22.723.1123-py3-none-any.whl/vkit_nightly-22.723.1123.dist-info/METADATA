**NOTICE: Documentation is out-of-date. Will be updated in version `22.3.1`.**

[vkit](https://github.com/vkit-x/vkit) is a toolkit designed for CV (Computer Vision) developers, especially targeting document image analysis and optical character recognition workloads:

* Supporting rich data augmentation strategies:
  * Common [photometric distortion](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/feature/photometric-distortion/interface) strategies such as various colorspace manipulation methods and image noise related techniques
  * ⭐ Common [geometric distortion](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/feature/geometric-distortion/interface) strategies such as various affine transformations and non-linear transformations (e.g. [similarity MLS](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/feature/geometric-distortion/mls#similarity_mls), [camera-model based 3D surface curving](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/feature/geometric-distortion/camera#camera_cubic_curve), [folding effect](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/feature/geometric-distortion/camera#camera_plane_line_fold), etc.)
  * ⭐ Simultaneously transforming labeled data while performing geometric distortion. As an example, while an image was rotated, vkit will rotate the corresponding positional label (e.g. image mask, polygons) at the same time without manual intervention.
* Supporting comprehensive data type encapsulation and the corresponding visualization:
  * [Image type](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/utility/image) (encapsulation based on PIL, supporting reading/writing various image file types)
  * [Labeled data type](https://vkit.vkit-x.com/utility/label): mask, score map, box, polygon and so on
* Industrial-grade code quality:
  * Auto-completion and type hint friendly, making it practical to be used in production
  * Matured package and dependency management
  * Automated code style enforcement (based on flake8) and static type checker (based on pyright)

Remarks: ⭐ Highlights (features that other similar projects have not, or not elegantly supported)

## Objectives

The author, as a CV/NLP engineer, wishes to bring the convenience to developers in the aforementioned disciplines through this project:

* To free developers from the tedious data governance tasks, therefore more time can be spent on actual high-value work such as the data governance strategies, model designing and fine tuning
* To consolidate common data augmentation techniques, aiming to aid document image analysis and recognition researches, and their industrial practices. The author wishes to make the "secret sauce", i.e. the industrial grade data augmentation methods, available to public
* To construct open-source industrial document image analysis and recognition solutions powered by vkit:
  * Distortion correction
  * Hyper resolution
  * OCR
  * Layout Analysis
  * ...
