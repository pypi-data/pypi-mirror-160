## PyBioSci
**Py**thon **BioSci**ence is a package containing different functionalities on different BioScience algorithms. 
Initially the package will be focused on the Microbiome data analysis, later the functionalities will be expanded to other BioScience tasks. 


### Diversity Indices
This module contains different **alpha** and **beta** diversity indices to calculate the diversity of a sample and a group of samples. All the indices are discussed in this [paper](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/4/679/2871295?login=false).

Below an example code for finding diversity indices has been shown: 

```
from pybiosci.diversity_indicies import alpha_index 
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data/simCounts.csv')
print(alpha_index(df, index='Shannon'))
```

The dataframe is expected to be in a definite format. Row represents the taxa and column represents each sample. Absolute read counts are taken as input and converted to relative abundance when required for an index.
