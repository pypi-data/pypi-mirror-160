## Quick Examples
The following example is only a very small CSS code piece, but should bring the idea across of how it works.
```python
from AthenaCSS import *
from AthenaColor import RGB # Dependecy on own other package

with (css_generator := CSSGenerator()) as generator:
    with (rule0 := CSSRule()) as (selector, declaration):
        selector.add(
            SelectorElement.H1(CSSClass("title")),
        )
        declaration.add(
            Property.Color(RGB(128,64,32)),
        )
    generator.add_comment(
        "The following sets the Header with the class of 'title' to have a specific color"
    ).add_rule(
        rule0
    )
css_generator.to_console()
```
The above code will output the following CSS to the console:
```css
/*The following sets the Header with the class of 'title' to have a specific color*/
h1.title {
    color: rgb(128, 64, 32);
}
```
