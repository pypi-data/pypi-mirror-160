``lenstronomy`` is a multi-purpose package to model strong gravitational lenses. The software package is presented in
`Birrer & Amara 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09746v1>`_ and `Birrer et al. 2021 <https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03283>`_ , and is based on `Birrer et al 2015 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...813..102B>`_.
``lenstronomy`` finds application for time-delay cosmography and measuring
the expansion rate of the Universe, for quantifying lensing substructure to infer dark matter properties, morphological quantification of galaxies,
quasar-host galaxy decomposition and much more.
A (incomplete) list of publications making use of lenstronomy can be found `at this link <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy/blob/main/PUBLISHED.rst>`_.


The development is coordinated on `GitHub <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy>`_ and contributions are welcome.
The documentation of ``lenstronomy`` is available at `readthedocs.org <http://lenstronomy.readthedocs.org/>`_ and
the package is distributed through PyPI_ and conda-forge_.
``lenstronomy`` is an `affiliated package <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/>`_ of `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_.

Getting started
---------------

The `starting guide jupyter notebook <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions/blob/main/lenstronomy_extensions/Notebooks/starting_guide.ipynb>`_
leads through the main modules and design features of ``lenstronomy``. The modular design of ``lenstronomy`` allows the
user to directly access a lot of tools and each module can also be used as stand-alone packages.

If you are new to gravitational lensing, check out the `mini lecture series <https://github.com/sibirrer/strong_lensing_lectures>`_ giving an introduction to gravitational lensing
with interactive Jupyter notebooks in the cloud.



Example notebooks
-----------------

We have made an extension module available at `https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions <https://github.com/sibirrer/lenstronomy_extensions>`_.
You can find simple examle notebooks for various cases. The latest versions of the notebooks should be compatible with the recent pip version of lenstronomy.
