Welcome to the `special` documentation
======================================

Recent technological progress in high-contrast imaging has allowed the spectral 
characterization of directly imaged giant planet and brown dwarf companions at 
ever shorter angular separation from their host stars, hence opening a new 
avenue to study their formation, evolution, and composition.
 
In this context, ``special`` is a Python package providing the tools to 
analyse the low- to medium-resolution optical/IR spectra of these directly 
imaged (sub)stellar companions. While some tools are specific to the SPEctral Characterization of directly ImAged Low-mass companions, the main features of ``special`` can also be used in a more general way for the characterisation of any object with a measured spectrum, provided an input model or template grid.
