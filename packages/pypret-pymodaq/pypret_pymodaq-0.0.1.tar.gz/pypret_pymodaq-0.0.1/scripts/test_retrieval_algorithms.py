""" This script tests COPRA against a lot of different PNPS schemes
and compares it against PCGPA and ptychographic retrieval for SHG-FROG.
It reproduces the data of Fig. 4, 5 and 7 from [Geib2019]_.

Notes
-----
As we are using multiprocessing to speed up the parameter scan you may not be 
able to run this script inside of an IDE such as spyder. In that case
please run the script from the commandline using standard Python.

For plotting the results see `test_retrieval_algorithms_plot.py`.
