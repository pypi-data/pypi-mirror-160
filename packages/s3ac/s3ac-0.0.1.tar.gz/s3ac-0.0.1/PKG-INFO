# s3ac

A small IPython extension that auto-completes S3 URIS.

To install: `pip install s3ac`

```bash
$ ipython
Python 3.9.13 (main, Jun  9 2022, 00:00:00) 
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 8.4.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: %load_ext s3ac

In [2]: from s3ac import s3

In [3]: s3("<hit tab>
```


To use, start an expression with `s3("`, hit tab, see buckets. 
After selecting a bucket and hitting tab, `s3 ("my_bucket/` 
will complete prefixes up to the next slash and objects with that prefix.

For example, tabbing after `s3("my_bucket1/d` might suggest:

```
my_bucket1/diary.txt
my_bucket1/dir1/
my_bucket1/dir2/
my_bucket1/dungeons_and_dragons.csv
```

The s3 function will return a URI (for example, `"s3://my_bucket/dir1/dir2/file.txt"`).

Depends only on boto3 and requires an AWS credentials file in ~/.aws.
