Description: GluonCV Python Package
        =========================
        `GluonCV <https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io>`_ provides implementations of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models in computer vision.
        
        It is designed for engineers, researchers, and students to fast prototype products and research ideas based on these models.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install, use:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install gluoncv mxnet>=1.6.0 --upgrade
            # for installing gluoncv with all dependencies
            pip install gluoncv[full] mxnet>=1.6.0 --upgrade
        
        To enable different hardware supports such as GPUs, check out  `mxnet variants <https://pypi.org/project/mxnet/>`_.
        
        For example, you can install cuda-11.0 supported mxnet alongside gluoncv:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install gluoncv mxnet-cu110>=1.6.0 --upgrade
