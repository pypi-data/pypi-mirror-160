We also recommend using miniconda to manage your Python environments. Download and follow the `Miniconda installation guide`_ for the appropriate
Miniconda installer for your operating system. 

.. _Miniconda installation guide: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

Make sure to add the channel, `conda-forge`_, to your .condarc. You can
find out more about conda-forge from their website:

.. _conda-forge: https://conda-forge.org/

You can do this with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

        conda config --add channels conda-forge

From sources
------------

The sources for cool_maps can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:
