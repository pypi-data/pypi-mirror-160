# cdk-s3bucket-ng

cdk-s3bucket-ng is an AWS CDK construct library that provides a drop-in replacement for the Bucket construct with the capability to remove non-empty S3 buckets.

## Install

```bash
Use the npm dist tag to opt in CDKv1 or CDKv2:

// for CDKv2
npm install cdk-s3bucket-ng
or
npm install cdk-s3bucket-ng@latest

// for CDKv1
npm install cdk-s3bucket-ng@cdkv1
```

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ please click [here](https://github.com/neilkuan/cdk-s3bucket/tree/cdkv1#readme), if you are using aws-cdk v1.x.x version.ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

# Why

Sometime we just do some lab , create a S3 Bucket.
Want to destroy resource , after Lab finished.
But We forget delete Object in S3 Bucket first , so destroy will fail.

`cdk-s3bucket-ng`  can help delete object when cdk destroy , just add `removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY`  property .

You never have to delete objects yourself, and the usage is almost the same as the native @aws-cdk/aws-s3.Bucket

## Now Try It !!!

# Sample

```python
import { App, Stack, CfnOutput, RemovalPolicy }  from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { BucketNg } from 'cdk-s3bucket-ng';
import * as s3deploy from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3-deployment';

// Create a S3 , add props "removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY".
const bucket = new BucketNg(stack, 'Bucket',{
  removalPolicy: RemovalPolicy.DESTROY,
});

//Upload temp file .
new s3deploy.BucketDeployment(stack, 'addResource', {
    sources: [s3deploy.Source.asset('./testdir')],
    destinationBucket: bucket,
  });
// Get S3 Resource via bucket.s3Bucket ...
new CfnOutput(stack, 'BucketName', { value: bucket.bucketName });
```

```bash
# create temp file .
mkdir ./testdir
touch ./testdir/{a.txt,b.txt,c.txt}
ls ./testdir
a.txt  b.txt  c.txt
```

### To deploy

```bash
cdk deploy
```

### To destroy

```bash
# will delete object in S3 , and delete S3 Bucket
cdk destroy
```

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param access_control: Specifies a canned ACL that grants predefined permissions to the bucket. Default: BucketAccessControl.PRIVATE
        :param auto_delete_objects: Whether all objects should be automatically deleted when the bucket is removed from the stack or when the stack is deleted. Requires the ``removalPolicy`` to be set to ``RemovalPolicy.DESTROY``. **Warning** if you have deployed a bucket with ``autoDeleteObjects: true``, switching this to ``false`` in a CDK version *before* ``1.126.0`` will lead to all objects in the bucket being deleted. Be sure to update your bucket resources by deploying with CDK version ``1.126.0`` or later **before** switching this value to ``false``. Default: false
        :param block_public_access: The block public access configuration of this bucket. Default: - CloudFormation defaults will apply. New buckets and objects don't allow public access, but users can modify bucket policies or object permissions to allow public access
        :param bucket_key_enabled: Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key with server-side encryption using KMS (SSE-KMS) for new objects in the bucket. Only relevant, when Encryption is set to {@link BucketEncryption.KMS} Default: - false
        :param bucket_name: Physical name of this bucket. Default: - Assigned by CloudFormation (recommended).
        :param cors: The CORS configuration of this bucket. Default: - No CORS configuration.
        :param encryption: The kind of server-side encryption to apply to this bucket. If you choose KMS, you can specify a KMS key via ``encryptionKey``. If encryption key is not specified, a key will automatically be created. Default: - ``Kms`` if ``encryptionKey`` is specified, or ``Unencrypted`` otherwise.
        :param encryption_key: External KMS key to use for bucket encryption. The 'encryption' property must be either not specified or set to "Kms". An error will be emitted if encryption is set to "Unencrypted" or "Managed". Default: - If encryption is set to "Kms" and this property is undefined, a new KMS key will be created and associated with this bucket.
        :param enforce_ssl: Enforces SSL for requests. S3.5 of the AWS Foundational Security Best Practices Regarding S3. Default: false
        :param intelligent_tiering_configurations: Inteligent Tiering Configurations. Default: No Intelligent Tiiering Configurations.
        :param inventories: The inventory configuration of the bucket. Default: - No inventory configuration
        :param lifecycle_rules: Rules that define how Amazon S3 manages objects during their lifetime. Default: - No lifecycle rules.
        :param metrics: The metrics configuration of this bucket. Default: - No metrics configuration.
        :param notifications_handler_role: The role to be used by the notifications handler. Default: - a new role will be created.
        :param object_ownership: The objectOwnership of the bucket. Default: - No ObjectOwnership configuration, uploading account will own the object.
        :param public_read_access: Grants public read access to all objects in the bucket. Similar to calling ``bucket.grantPublicAccess()`` Default: false
        :param removal_policy: Policy to apply when the bucket is removed from this stack. Default: - The bucket will be orphaned.
        :param server_access_logs_bucket: Destination bucket for the server access logs. Default: - If "serverAccessLogsPrefix" undefined - access logs disabled, otherwise - log to current bucket.
        :param server_access_logs_prefix: Optional log file prefix to use for the bucket's access logs. If defined without "serverAccessLogsBucket", enables access logs to current bucket with this prefix. Default: - No log file prefix
        :param transfer_acceleration: Whether this bucket should have transfer acceleration turned on or not. Default: false
        :param versioned: Whether this bucket should have versioning turned on or not. Default: false
        :param website_error_document: The name of the error document (e.g. "404.html") for the website. ``websiteIndexDocument`` must also be set if this is set. Default: - No error document.
