Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: MetaPhlAn
Version: 3.1.0
Summary: MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial communities (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes) from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data (i.e. not 16S) with species-level. With the newly added StrainPhlAn module, it is now possible to perform accurate strain-level microbial profiling.

        ## What's new in version 3.1
        * 433 low-quality species were removed from the MetaPhlAn 3.1 marker database and 2,680 species were added (for a new total of 15,766; a 17% increase).
        * Marker genes for a subset of existing bioBakery 3 species were also revised.
        * Most existing bioBakery 3 species pangenomes were updated with revised or expanded gene content.
        * MetaPhlAn 3.1 software has been updated to work with revised marker database.

        ## Description
        MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial communities (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes) from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data (i.e. not 16S) with species-level. With the newly added StrainPhlAn module, it is now possible to perform accurate strain-level microbial profiling.
        
        MetaPhlAn relies on ~1.1M unique clade-specific marker genes (the latest marker information file `mpa_v31_CHOCOPhlAn_201901_marker_info.txt.bz2` can be found  [here](http://cmprod1.cibio.unitn.it/biobakery3/metaphlan_databases/mpa_v31_CHOCOPhlAn_201901_marker_info.txt.bz2)) identified from ~100,000 reference genomes (~99,500 bacterial and archaeal and ~500 eukaryotic), allowing:
        
        * unambiguous taxonomic assignments;
        * accurate estimation of organismal relative abundance;
        * species-level resolution for bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses;
        * strain identification and tracking
        * orders of magnitude speedups compared to existing methods.
        * metagenomic strain-level population genomics

        ## Installation
        The best way to install MetaPhlAn is through conda via the Bioconda channel. If you have not configured you Anaconda installation in order to fetch packages from Bioconda, **please follow [these steps](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html#set-up-channels) in order to setup the channels.**
        
        You can install MetaPhlAn by running
        
        ```
        $ conda install -c bioconda python=3.7 metaphlan
        ```
        
        For installing it from the source code and for further installation instructions, please see the Wiki at the [Installation](https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn/wiki/MetaPhlAn-3.0#installation) paragraph.
