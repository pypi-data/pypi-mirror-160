# Carsomenlp Package

## Why?
There several tasks where natural language is used to extract information. These use-cases became frquent and therefore there should be a better way to execute them. The old way of using piles of python lines to extract a brand name or model are gone. This package is the new easy and effient way to deal with natural text in Carsome.
