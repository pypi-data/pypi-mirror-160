The prompt can be avoided by exporting them as environment variables:
```bash
export ANCHOR_EMAIL='YOUR ANCHOR FM EMAIL HERE'
export ANCHOR_PASSWORD='YOUR ANCHOR FM PASSWORD HERE'
```

## Roadmap

* add better test case
* add better error catching
* include podcast publish date
* create documentation  
* ~~Test tool in microsoft powershell~~
* ~~make available on pypi~~

## Running it with Windows 
**Method 1: pip install**  
Assuming you have python and pip installed already, open Command Prompt or Windows Powershell  
Run this command: `pip install tube-cast`
Once the install is done you can simply run `pip list` to double check the package was installed
run the command: `cls` to clear the command prompt/powershell  
You should now be able to run tube-cast commands. To start run this command: `tube-cast --help`

**Method 2: github download**  
Simply download and extract the github.  
With the folder open you can right click any white-space in the "tube-cast-main" folder and open in terminal, run this command `pip install .`   
with Command Prompt simply copy the "tube-cast-main" folder path > open CMD type in *cd* PastePath, you can now run this command `pip install .` 

**Note:** Method 2 is good if you need to edit the program yourself. You'll simply edit the python files you need changed, follow the steps and instead of running `pip install .` Youll be doing `pip install . --upgrade` Doing so will update the package with your desired changes.

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Create new Pull Request

## Testing

To test your changes generate a distribution package
To do so make sure you have the latest version of PyPAâ€™s build installed:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
```
Now run this command from the projects root directory:
```
python3 -m build
```
This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the dist directory:
```
dist/
  example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
  example_package_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

Hop into a Virtual Environment:
```
python3 -m venv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate
```
Install the newly created package
```
pip install dist/tube-cast-<VERSION>.tar.gz
```
