# Mypy stubs for the PySide2 (Qt5 for Python)

*Author :* Philippe Fremy

The official typing stubs delivered along [Qt5 for Python/PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/) are insufficent 
for proper typing verification with `mypy`. This package fixes this by providing curated and updated stubs.

### Improvements:
* fix `Signal` to make it accept method emit()
* fix `qVersion()` returns string, not bytes
* fix `QMessageBox.warning`, information, critical, question, about, aboutQt to accept None as parent argument
* fix `QProgressDialog.setCancelButton()` accepting None
* fix `QTreeWidgetItem` comparison with `<`
* fix `Signal.connect()` return value to bool instead of None
* fix `QTimer.timeout` undeclared signal
* support all `QSize` and `QSizeF` operations
* fix `QLineEdit.setText()` to accept None
* add `QDialogButtonBox.StandardButton` `__or__` operations
* fix missing methods being undetected for all Qt objects
* add all missing signals to the stubs (many were missing)
* fix all method accepting a `QCursor` to accept also a `Qt.CursorShape`
* add conversion from `QByteArray` to bytes
* add `exec()` to QDialog
* fix `data()` and `setData()` to accept Qt.ItemDataRole
* add all method for operations on QFlag derived classes: `__or__`, `__xor__`, ...
* fix all method accepting a QColor to accept also a `Qt.GlobalColor`
* fix signature of `QCoreApplication.translate()`
* fix `QLabel.setAlignment()` to accept also Qt.AlignmentFlag


See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

This effort was inspired by the [PyQt5-stubs](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5-stubs/) project.

Please note that this work is far from complete. Don't hesitate to report problems or propose improvements.


# Licensing
As a derived work from PySide2, the stubs are delivered under the LGPL v2.1 . See file LICENSE for more details.


# Installation

Simply install the official PySide2-stubs with pip:

    $ pip install PySide2-stubs

Or use the latest version from Github:

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/python-qt-tools/PySide2-stubs


That's it, in both cases, the new stubs are picked up automatically by `mypy`. Typechecking process should be much better.


# Help improve the stubs

If you notice incorrect or missing typing information (mypy reports errors eventhough your code is correct), please report it
here with the following steps:

* create an issue showing your problem
* even better, create a PR to fix the problem
    * make sure to add a test showing what is mistyped. Just create a file under `tests/` , with a name
      not starting with *test*. The test suite will run the file and type-check it.
    * fix the stubs in the PySide2-stubs directory
    * and open the PR
