[Output]
## `path` is the default path to write to.
## The `--output-path` option overrides it.
## A path of `-` represents standard output.
## For example, lighting profile 9 on Linux is often at a path like:
#path = /media/_your username_/FS EDGE RGB/lighting/led9.txt

[ColorAPI]
## Color scheme generation mode to use, for both the regular and fn layers.
## See the list of supported modes in the ColorAPI documentation at:
##   <https://www.thecolorapi.com/docs#schemes-generate-scheme-get>
#mode = analogic
#fn mode = monochrome

[Palette]
## If you don't specify a base color, MonkeyPaint picks one randomly.
## You can require the base color to have a minimum amount of RGB,
## a number in the range 0-765 inclusive.
#minimum base = 384

## A set of configuration sections that share a prefix define key
## groupings. Each grouping will be assigned a color.
## This setting defines the section name prefix for the groupings used by
## default. Note how this matches the section names below.
#group prefix = Group

## Other sections define key groupings.
## Monkeypaint will generate a palette with one color per grouping, and the
## lighting profile will assign each key the color from its grouping.
## If a key appears in more than one section, the last section wins.
## You can refer to keys individually by name, or by group name.
## Refer to the README for the full list of supported key names.

## Below are the default groupings.
[Group 1]
alphanumeric
punctuation
space

[Group 2]
meta
function
editing

[Group 3]
navigation
hotkeys

[Group 4]
actions
arrows

## You can define other sets of groupings.
## The section names just need to each share a unique prefix.
## You can use this set by running `monkeypaint -g Rows`
