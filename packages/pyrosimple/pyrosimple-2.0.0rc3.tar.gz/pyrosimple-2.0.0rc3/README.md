[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pyrosimple)](https://pypi.org/project/pyrosimple/)
![PyPI -	Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pyrosimple)

A overhauled Python 3 fork  of the [pyrocore tools](https://github.com/pyroscope/pyrocore), for working with the [rTorrent client](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent).

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyrosimple
```

See the [documentation for usage](https://kannibalox.github.io/pyrosimple/). If you've used rtcontrol/rtxmlrpc before, you should feel right at home.

## What's the point of this?

The pyrocore tools are great, but being stuck on python 2, along with the complicated install procedure made integrating both the tools and the code into other processes very painful.

## Differences from pyrocore

The following lists are not exhaustive, and don't cover many of the internal improvements and refactoring.

- Only supports python 3 and rtorrent 0.9.8+ (0.9.6/0.9.7 should still work just fine, but aren't officially supported)
- Simpler poetry-based build/install system
- Everything in one package (no separate pyrobase)
  - Use external lib for bencode

### New features
- Multi-instance support for rtcontrol/rtxmlrpc
- Replaced Tempita with jinja2
- Support for JSON-RPC (only implemented by https://github.com/jesec/rtorrent)
- pyrotorque job to move torrents between hosts
- pyrotorque job to move torrent paths
