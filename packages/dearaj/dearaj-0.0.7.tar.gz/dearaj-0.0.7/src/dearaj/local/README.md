# folder 'local'

This folder contains detailed conference info - every `Movie` and `Speak` for faster loading speed. Otherwise the user will need to grab info by sending HTTP requests every time, and this may cause the website's negative reaction.

The built-in `data` folder only stores basic general info about a conference.
