"""Tesseract no-op plugin that simulates the OOM killer on page 4.

OCRmyPDF can use a lot of memory, even that it might trigger the
OOM killer on Linux or similar features on other platforms. We want to
ensure we fail with an error rather than deadlock in such cases.

Page 4 was chosen because of this number's association with bad luck
in many East Asian cultures.
