#### Description
Python library for easy managing and processing of large Long-Term Biosignals.
This repository is object of evaluation of some Master's and Doctoral's theses.

#### Language and Dependencies
Developed and tested on Python 3.10.4. See Python dependencies in `requirements.txt`, and install the following on your machine if needed:
* `graphviz` to plot Pipeline diagrams (`sudo apt-get install graphviz` or `brew install graphviz`)
* `h5py` to read HDF5 files if running on an Apple Sillicon machine (`brew install hdf5 && export HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/bin/brew/Cellar/hdf5/<version>`)
