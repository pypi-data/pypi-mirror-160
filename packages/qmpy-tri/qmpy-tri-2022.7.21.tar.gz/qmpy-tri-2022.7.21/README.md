## NOTICE:

This is a hackish fork of [qmpy](https://github.com/wolverton-research-group/qmpy) intended to have minimal functionality for thermodynamic analysis and be python 3 compatible.  It is NOT supported.  Use at your own risk.

qmpy
====

A toolkit for storing crystal structure data, automating calculations, handing computational resources and performing thermodynamic analysis.
