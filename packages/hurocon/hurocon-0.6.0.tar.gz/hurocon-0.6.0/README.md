## Supported Devices
Full list of supported devices is available on [this link](https://github.com/Salamek/huawei-lte-api#tested-on).


## Availability
This tool is OS-independent, which means it should work on any platform where python3 can run. Minimal python3 version required for this package is `3.7`. This does not mean that it cannot work on python versions below the minimal, but its behavior is unpredictable and no support will be provided for any issues.


## Installation
- You can install it from PyPi:

  ```bash
  pip install hurocon
  ```

- Or directly from Github repo:

  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/maximilionus/hurocon.git
  ```

> Currently can only be installed with `pip` on `python >= 3.7`. Binary bundle *([pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/)-based)* is planned but no ETA yet


## Quickstart
### Intro
After successful [installation](#installation) of this tool it can be accessed in shell using the following commands:

```bash
$ hurocon
# OR
$ python -m hurocon
```

You can also view a list of all main commands with:
```bash
$ hurocon --help
```

Each command and subcommand in this tool has a special `--help` flag to display detailed information about it

### Authentication
