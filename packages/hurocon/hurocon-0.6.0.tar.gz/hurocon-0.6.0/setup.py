Minimal python3 version required for this package is `3.7`. This does not mean that it cannot work on python versions below the minimal, but its behavior is unpredictable and no support will be provided for any issues.\n\n\n## Installation\n- You can install it from PyPi:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install hurocon\n  ```\n\n- Or directly from Github repo:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install git+https://github.com/maximilionus/hurocon.git\n  ```\n\n> Currently can only be installed with `pip` on `python >= 3.7`. Binary bundle *([pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/)-based)* is planned but no ETA yet\n\n\n## Quickstart\n### Intro\nAfter successful [installation](#installation) of this tool it can be accessed in shell using the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ hurocon\n# OR\n$ python -m hurocon\n```\n\nYou can also view a list of all main commands with:\n```bash\n$ hurocon --help\n```\n\nEach command and subcommand in this tool has a special `--help` flag to display detailed information about it\n\n### Authentication\nForemost, you need to specify the authentication details so that this tool can access the device.\n``` bash\n$ hurocon auth login\n```\n\n### Testing Connection\nAfter auth details successfully specified you can test your connection with router by running\n\n```bash\n$ hurocon auth test\n\n# Returns\n# Success: Successful Authentication\n# Failure: Auth failed, reason: "..."\n```\n\n### Conclusion\nThat\'s it, you\'re ready to go. And remember - no matter how deep you go, `--help` flag is always here to help 👍\n\n\n## Development\n### Prepare The Environment\nTo prepare the development environment for this project, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install `poetry` package manager with ([pip](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/), [standalone](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer) *(recommended)*)\n\n2. Run the command below to prepare the virtual environment for this project\n   ```bash\n   $ poetry install\n   ```\n\n3. That\'s it, now you can modify the code the way you want and test it in two ways\n    - Run this tool with\n      ```bash\n      $ poetry run hurocon\n      ```\n    - Or activate the project environment with\n      ```bash\n      $ poetry shell\n      Spawning shell within ...\n\n      $ hurocon\n      ```\n\n### Build\n#### Python Package\nTo build this tool to package *([sdist](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html) and wheel)* you should execute:\n\n```bash\n$ poetry build\nBuilding hurocon ...\n```\n\nPrepared for distribution package will be located in `./dist/` directory\n\n\n## Special\nBig thanks to [Adam Schubert](https://github.com/Salamek) for his amazing [`huawei-lte-api`](https://github.com/Salamek/huawei-lte-api) package, that made this whole thing possible.\n',
