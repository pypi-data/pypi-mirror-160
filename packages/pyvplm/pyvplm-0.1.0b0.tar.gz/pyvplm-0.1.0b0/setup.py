Those DOE are the inputs of parametrized finite-element models.\n- Regression models construction with increasing  complexity (terms sorted based on their impact) and validation based \non relative error repartition analysis.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n#### Dimensional analysis\n\nThe dimensional analysis has to be conducted on a defined set of physical parameters. It can be performed using \nalternatively `buckingham_theorem` which will return the default solution or `automatic_buckingham` which will propose \ndifferent alternate sets.\n\nBased on the obtained solutions, advanced user can also define manually a new solution set with `force_buckingham` \nfunction.\n\n```\nfrom pyvplm.core.definition import PositiveParameter, PositiveParameterSet\nfrom pyvplm.addon.variablepowerlaw import buckingham_theorem\nd = PositiveParameter(\'d\', [10e-3, 150e-3],\'m\', \'pipe internal diameter\')\ne = PositiveParameter(\'e\', [.1e-3, 10e-3], \'m\', \'pipe thickness\')\nparameter_set = PositiveParameterSet(d,e)\npi_set, _ = buckingham_theorem(parameter_set, track=False)\n```\n\n#### Sensitivity & dependency analysis\n\nOnce dimensional analysis is done, there may be still a huge number of dimensionless parameter to describe a \nperformance criteria (mostly form factor) and DOE construction phase may lead to big experiments number and long \nsimulation times.\n\nThis is to answer this problematic that `pi_sensitivity` and `pi_dependency` functions have been designed. The obtained \ngraph for analysis are based on primary vs. secondary parameters analysis that can be easily adapted using \nconfiguration parameters:\n\n![](./docs/source/_static/Pictures/variablepowerlaw_pi_sensitivity.png)\n\n------\n\n![](./docs/source/_static/Pictures/variablepowerlaw_pi_dependency.png)\n\n#### Optimized design of experiments\n\nThe non-constrained nor reduced experimental set are defined using [pyDOE2](https://github.com/clicumu/pyDOE2) package. \nIt integrates automatic sizing of physical/dimensionless initial test plans and functions for selection based on \ndistance criteria (dimensionless mapping) and spread quality (physical mapping).\n\n![](./docs/source/_static/Pictures/pixdoe_create_const_doe1.png)\n\n------\n\n![](./docs/source/_static/Pictures/pixdoe_create_const_doe2.png)\n\n#### Regression models construction\n\nThe `regression_models` function interpolate results to fit a given order polynomial model within linear or logarithmic \nspace. \n\nWithin log space, the model obtained can be transformed into variable power-law model, indeed:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n    log(\\pi_0) = a_0+a_1 \\cdot log(\\pi_1) + a_{11} \\cdot log(\\pi_1)^2+a_{12} \\cdot log(\\pi_1) \\cdot log(\\pi_2) + a_2 \\cdot log(\\pi_2) +...\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nCan be expressed in the following form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n    \\pi_0 = 10^{a_0} \\cdot \\pi_1 ^{a_1 + a_{11} \\cdot log(\\pi_1)+a_{12} \\cdot log(\\pi_2)+...} \\cdot  \\pi_2^{a_2+...} \\cdot ...\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis is the origin of package name since variable power-law model is one of the current research subject of MS2M team \nin [ICA](http://institut-clement-ader.org/home/) Laboratory (Toulouse-France). \n\nRegression coefficients are sorted with increasing magnitude while considering standardized values regression (first \norder terms are selected at the beginning to avoid singularity issues):\n\n![](./docs/source/_static/Pictures/variablepowerlaw_regression_models1.png)\n\n<u>The four criteria to evaluate model fidelity with leave-one-out cross-validation are:</u>\n\n1. Maximal relative error magnitude\n2. Average value of the magnitude of relative error which is a good indicator of both average and standard deviation\n3. Average value of the relative error\n4. Standard deviation of the relative error\n\nOn this example with 2 dimensionless parameters and order 3 polynomial expression, a 5-terms model seems to have good \nrepresentation capabilities.\n\n------\n\nOnce regression models have been constructed, each one of them can be analyzed through the analysis of their relative \nerror using `perform_regression` function:\n\n![](./docs/source/_static/Pictures/variablepowerlaw_perform_regression1.png)\n\n## Examples and notes\n\nFour Jupyter Notebooks have been developed to present tool capabilities and functions. They can be launched \nusing Jupyter Notebook application and opening `.ipynb` files from `master/notebooks` folder.\n\nAdditional documentation on sub-packages (`pyvplm.core`, `pyvplm.addon`) and functions can be found on the online \n[readthedocs](https://pyvplm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation.\n\n## Install\n\nTo install pyVPLM, simply run:\n\n`pip install pyvplm`\n\n\n## Credit\n\npyVPLM is an adaptation of the work performed by MS2M team at [ICA Laboratory](http://institut-clement-ader.org/) - \nFrance and covers the work done during different doctorate thesis:\n\n- Copyright (C) 2014 - 2017 - [Florian Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-sanchez-7b65ba43/)\n- Copyright (C) 2017 - 2019 - \n[Francesco De Giorgi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-de-giorgi/?originalSubdomain=fr)\n\n## Author\n\n[A.
