"""
The widget system.

Basic concept
-------------

Everything starts with the `Widget` class. It represents a single part
of the overarching system. Simple widgets like `Label` simply implement
a `get_lines` method, in which they can come up with what to display as.

The more complex type widget is something like `Container`. This widget holds
other widgets within itself, and uses some fancy logic to display them
in a neat and organized way.


Magic methods
-------------

Most widgets support a selection of magic methods, also known as dunders.
For example, all `Container` children are iterable by default, and allow
adding elements using the `+=` operator. You can also index into them, if
that floats your boat.


Demo
----

There is a lot more information specific to each widget, located in its
documentation. For now, here is a cool showcase of this part of pytermgui.

```python3
import sys
import pytermgui as ptg

with ptg.alt_buffer():
    root = ptg.Container(
        ptg.Label("[210 bold]This is a title"),
        ptg.Label(""),
        ptg.Label("[italic grey]This is some body text. It is very interesting."),
        ptg.Label(),
        ptg.Button("[red]Stop application!", onclick=lambda *_: sys.exit()),
        ptg.Button("[green]Do nothing"),
    )

    root.center().print()

    while True:
        root.handle_key(ptg.getch())
        root.print()
```
