A plugin to analyse point spread funcitons (PSFs) of optical systems.

## Usage
### Starting Point
To run a PSF analysis open an image of acquired beads. Add a point-layer
and indicate the beads you want to measure by adding a point.

### Run Analyis
Open the plugin (Plugins > napari-psf-analysis > PSF Analysis) and ensure
that your bead image and point layers are select in the `Basic` tab under
`Image` and `Points` respectively.
In the `Advanced` tab further information can be provided. Only the filled
in fields of the `Advanced` tab are saved in the output.

After verifying all input fields click `Extract PSFs`.

### Discard and Save Measurement
Once the PSF extraction has finished a new layer (`Analyzed Beads`) appears,
holding a summary
image for every selected bead.
Individual summaries can be discarded by clicking the `Delete Displayed
Measurement` button.

Results are saved to the selected `Save Dir` by clicking the `Save
Measurements` button.

Note: Beads for which the bounding box does not fit within the image are
automatically excluded from the analysis and no output is generated.


### Saved Data
Every image of the `Analyzed Beads` layer is saved as `{source_image_name}_X
{bead-centroid-x}_Y{bead-centroid-y}_Z{bead-centroid-z}.png` file.
Additionally a `PSFMeasurement_{source_image_acquisition_date}_
{source_image_name}_{microscope_name}_{magnification}_{NA}.csv` file is
stored containing the measured values and all filled in fields.
