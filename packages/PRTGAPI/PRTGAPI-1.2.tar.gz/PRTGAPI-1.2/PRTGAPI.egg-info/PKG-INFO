PRTG API SIMPLIFIED
===================

This python package helps simplify the PRTG API (v1) by making the experience more pythonic.

The current methods are:

    * get_probe_list
    * get_sensor_list
    * get_device_list
    * get_device
    * find_device_id
    * remove_object
    * duplicate_device

    * username: Your user account name (account should be an administrator)
    * password: Your user account password
    * passhash: Your user account passhash (a password alternative, the hash is found in account settings)
