Installation
============

Requirements: `python >= 3.8`, `libarchive`

### Linux

Before installing `d4m`, you first need to install libarchive.

For Ubuntu, this can be installed with

`sudo apt install libarchive-dev`

For Arch Linux (e.g Steam Deck), libarchive should already be installed.

After installing libarchive, install `d4m` via pip:

`python -m pip install d4m`

### For Windows (Bundled)

Download the latest d4m installer from the [releases page.](https://github.com/Brod8362/d4m/releases)

### From Source

*Note: libarchive must be installed 

```
git clone https://github.com/Brod8362/d4m
cd d4m
python -m pip install build
python -m build
python -m pip install dist/*.whl
```

### From Source (Development)

*Note: libarchive must be installed

```
git clone https://github.com/Brod8362/d4m
cd d4m
git checkout unstable
python -m pip install build
python -m pip install -e .
```

Running
=======

Linux/Windows (via pip)
-----

`python -m d4m` (TUI)

`python -m d4m -g` (GUI)

You can place an alias in your shell config, e.g `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

> `alias d4m='python -m d4m'`

FAQ
===

- Why is DivaModLoader installation not supported on my platform?

> As of d4m 0.3.1, `libarchive` is *required* for installations on all platforms.

> As of d4m 0.3.0, `libarchive` should be bundled with all Windows installations.

Currently, automatic DivaModLoader installation/updating depends on `libarchive`. Most Windows users likely don't have this installed, and I don't want to make it a hard dependency of the application.

`libarchive` is needed because the packager of DivaModLoader creates archives using BCJ2, which is not supported by `py7zr`.

If you manually install `libarchive` and the corresponding pip package (`libarchive`), you should then be able to auto install/update DML.

Configuration
=============
You can override some parameters of d4m via environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Purpose                    | Default                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `D4M_INSTALL_DIR`    | MegaMix+ install directory | Auto-determined via steam |
