FAQ
===

- Why is DivaModLoader installation not supported on my platform?

> As of d4m 0.3.0, `libarchive` should be bundled with all Windows installations.

Currently, automatic DivaModLoader installation/updating depends on `libarchive`. Most Windows users likely don't have this installed, and I don't want to make it a hard dependency of the application.

`libarchive` is needed because the packager of DivaModLoader creates archives using BCJ2, which is not supported by `py7zr`.

If you manually install `libarchive` and the corresponding pip package (`libarchive`), you should then be able to auto install/update DML.

Configuration
=============
You can override some parameters of d4m via environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Purpose                    | Default                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `D4M_INSTALL_DIR`    | MegaMix+ install directory | Auto-determined via steam |
